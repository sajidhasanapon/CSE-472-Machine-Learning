#### "To Whoever is Reading Me",  
###
###
# I am sorry. I truly am.
###
###
I don't usually write code this horrible. But, the deadline was near and, I was very tired, deprived of sleep. The result is this project.

To make it up to you, here is a poem.

### ***To Whoever is Reading Me***
***by Jorge Luis Borges***


```
		You are invulnerable. Have they not granted you,
		those powers that preordain your destiny,*
		the certainty of dust?  Is not your time
		as irreversible as that same river
		where Heraclitus, mirrored, saw the symbol
		of fleeting life?  A marble slab awaits you
		which you will not read - on it, already written,
		the date, the city, and the epitaph.
		Other men too are only dreams of time,
		not indestructible bronze or burnished gold;
		the universe is, like you, a Proteus.
		Dark, you will enter the darkness that awaits you,
		doomed to the limits of your traveled time.
		Know that in some sense you are already dead.
```
